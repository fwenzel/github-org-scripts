# github org helper scripts

Current minimums: python 3.7; GitHub3.py 1.3.0

***Please use [poetry](https://pypi.org/project/poetry/) to manage virtual environments - `requirements.txt` may be out of date, and does not include development dependencies.***

These are some API helper scripts for sanely managing a github org. For now this is somewhat hardcoded for the mozilla org; no need for it to remain that way though. Many scripts support the `--help` option. That information should be more up to date than information in this document.

## Credentials

Supplying credentials for execution is done by passing a PAT token as the value
of the environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN` (preferred) or `GITHUB_PAT`.

The recommended way to set `GITHUB_TOKEN` is via cli access to your password
manager. For example, using [pass][pass]:
```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=$(pass show myPAT) script args
```
[pass]: https://www.passwordstore.org/

## Jupyter Notebooks
### Docker Images

The Jupyter Notebooks currently still require python2. The recommended way to
deal with this is by using docker. Given the complexities of setting up Jupyter
to run in docker, a helper utility is use: `repo2docker`. The make targets
assume that is installed. Use `pipx install jupyter-repo2docker` to install.

The Makefile contains targets for building and running the docker images. Invoke
`make` without arguments to see those targets

### User Search.ipynb
Given a set of possible GitHub logins, determine if they might have any
permissions in various organizations. Links are provided for hits, so easy to
examine more closely.

N.B.: Both this script and the GitHub search interface make assumptions. It is
*your* responsibility to ensure any possible match is a valid match.

## Scripts

Scripts should now work with Python 3. Please open issues for any problems you
encounter.

### auditlog.py
Download audit log for $ORG via headless firefox via selenium
([``geckodriver``][gd_url] must be installed). Credentials as environment
variables, and 2FA token passed as input when requested.

### contributing.py
Analyze all the "sources" repositories (i.e., those that aren't forks) in a github org and list the repositories that do *NOT* have a CONTRIBUTING file.

### get_active_hooks.py
Find all hooks configured for an organization -- see --help for details

### get_org_info.py
Output basic info about an org, more if you have permissions. See --help for details

### lfs.py
Get current LFS Billing values using a headless firefox via selenium
(``geckodriver`` must be installed). Credentials as environment
variables, and 2FA token passed as input.

### manage_invitations.py
Cancel all org & repository invitations older than a specified age (default 2
weeks). See --help for details.

### team_update.py
Update administrative teams so they can be used for the new GitHub discussion
feature. Use the ``--help`` option for more information.

### Audit logs
Sadly, the org audit log does not have an API, so we'll screen scrape a little.

#### hooks.py
Analyzes a list of audit log export files (from the JS script) for hook/service creation/deletion and provides a summary. Use it to show commonly used apps/services/webhooks across the org.

### old_repos.py
Generate a list of empty (should be deleted) repositories as well as untouched repos (might need to be archived).
